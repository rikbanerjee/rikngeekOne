}
```

### Content

Update the content in each component file:
- **Projects**: Edit `components/Projects.tsx` - Add your projects
- **Blog**: Edit `components/Blog.tsx` - Add your blog posts
- **Research**: Edit `components/Research.tsx` - Add your publications
- **STEM**: Edit `components/STEMEducation.tsx` - Add educational resources
- **Resume**: Edit `components/Resume.tsx` - Update your experience and education

### Metadata

Update SEO metadata in `app/layout.tsx`:

```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Your Name - Your Title',
  description: 'Your description',
  // ... other metadata
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment

3. Deploy with one click

### Other Platforms

The site can be deployed on any platform that supports Next.js:
- Netlify
- AWS Amplify
- Google Cloud Run
- Cloudflare Pages

## 📝 Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🤖 Blog Agent CLI

Instead of manually editing React source files, use the three agent scripts in the `scripts/` folder. They handle everything — parsing your Markdown, asking you questions, and updating all three source files at once.

### ➕ Add a New Blog Post

1. Drop your `.md` file into the `posts/` folder (project root). Then use any of these:

```bash
# Just the filename — agent looks in posts/ automatically
npm run post my-ai-project.md

# No argument — agent lists all .md files in posts/ and lets you pick
npm run post

# Full or relative path — also works
node scripts/add-blog-post.js ~/Desktop/my-post.md
```

The agent will:

- Extract the title from your `# H1` heading and auto-generate a URL slug
- Detect the first paragraph as the excerpt (you can override it)
- Ask you **5 short questions** interactively:

| Prompt                                    | Example answer              |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Category (numbered menu)                  | `1` (AI & Machine Learning) |
| Excerpt — accept auto or type custom      | *(press Enter)*             |
| Tags (comma-separated)                    | `AI, Python, Monte Carlo`   |
| Read time — accept estimate or override   | `7 min read`                |
| Unsplash image URL — or Enter for default | *(press Enter)*             |

- Inject the post into `PostPage.js`, `BlogPage.js`, and `CategoryPage.js` automatically
- Print your live LinkedIn-ready URL:

```
🔗  URL: http://localhost:3000/post/your-post-slug
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Copy `posts/sample-post.md` as a starting template for your new post.

**Markdown features supported:** `# H1–H4`, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `inline code` ``, ` ```code blocks``` `, `- ul lists`, `1. ol lists`, `> blockquotes`, `[links](url)`, `--- dividers`

**Available categories:**

| #   | Category              | Color badge |
| --- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | AI & Machine Learning | Purple      |
| 2   | Retail IT             | Blue        |
| 3   | Enterprise Trends     | Green       |
| 4   | Tech Observations     | Orange      |
| 5   | Kids STEM             | Indigo      |

**Cover image — 3 options** (the agent asks you to pick):

| #   | Option                             | Best for                                      |
| --- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Local file from `public/images/` ⭐ | Your own screenshots, diagrams, custom photos |
| 2   | Unsplash or custom URL             | Stock photos, external images                 |
| 3   | Category default                   | Quick publish, don't care about the image     |

**Using your own images (option 1):**

1. Drop your image into `public/images/` — e.g. `public/images/stock-analyzer-dashboard.png`
2. Run `npm run post my-post.md`
3. Choose option 1 for image → the agent lists all files in `public/images/` and you pick by number
4. Vercel automatically serves it at `https://yoursite.com/images/stock-analyzer-dashboard.png`

> 💡 No external image hosting needed — Vercel's CDN serves everything in `public/` for free.

### ✏️ Edit an Existing Blog Post

```bash
node scripts/edit-blog-post.js
# or shorthand:
npm run edit-post
```

The agent will:

- List all your posts with title, date, category, and URL
- Ask you to pick a post by number
- Ask what to edit from a menu:

| #   | Option     | Notes                                                                             |
| --- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Title      | Updated in all 3 files                                                            |
| 2   | Excerpt    | Updated in all 3 files                                                            |
| 3   | Content    | Re-import from a new `.md` file                                                   |
| 4   | Category   | Updates color badge automatically                                                 |
| 5   | Tags       | Comma-separated list                                                              |
| 6   | Date       | Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`                                                              |
| 7   | Read time  | e.g. `8 min read`                                                                 |
| 8   | Image URL  | Unsplash URL — resizes automatically for cards vs post header                     |
| 9   | Everything | Full re-import from a `.md` file (title, content, excerpt, tags, read time, date) |

All three source files stay in sync after every edit.

### 🗑️ Delete a Blog Post

```bash
node scripts/delete-blog-post.js
# or shorthand:
npm run delete-post
```

The agent will:

- List all your posts — same numbered list as the editor
- Ask you to pick a post (enter `0` to cancel safely at any time)
- Show a confirmation card with the post's title, date, category, and slug
- **Auto-backup** all three source files to `scripts/.backups/` with a timestamp — before touching anything
- Remove the post entry from `PostPage.js`, `BlogPage.js`, and `CategoryPage.js`

> 💡 **To undo a delete:** restore the `.bak.js` files from `scripts/.backups/` — they are named with the exact timestamp shown after deletion.

---

### 📋 Blog Agent Quick Reference

```bash
# 1. Drop your .md file into posts/  (e.g. posts/my-ai-project.md)

# Publish a new post — just the filename, no path needed
npm run post my-ai-project.md

# Publish — pick from a list of .md files in posts/
npm run post

# Edit any field of an existing post interactively
npm run edit-post

# Delete a post (safe — auto-backup + confirmation required)
npm run delete-post

# Preview locally before publishing
npm start

# Push to git → triggers Vercel auto-deploy
npm run deploy
```
